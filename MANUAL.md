## 🏁 Conclusion

This platform requires a **dynamic, database-driven web application** with multiple user roles, real-time updates, and secure transaction handling. 

**Complexity Level:** Medium  
**Development Time:** 3-6 months for full launch (MVP in 8-12 weeks)  
**Team Size:** 1-3 developers (or solo developer with the right stack)  
**Tech Stack:** Next.js + TypeScript + Supabase + Vercel (modern, efficient, scalable)

The key to success is starting with an MVP, gathering user feedback, and iterating. Don't try to build everything at once!

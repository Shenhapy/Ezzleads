## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Add NEXTAUTH_SECRET to Environment

Your dev server is warning about missing `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`. Add this to your `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate_one_using_command_below
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Generate a secure secret:**

Run in PowerShell:
```powershell
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
```

Copy the output and paste it as your `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` value.

### 2. Restart Dev Server

After adding the secret:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Visit the Application

Open your browser: **http://localhost:3000**

### 4. Test Registration

1. Click "Get Started" button
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Full Name**: Your name
   - **Email**: test@example.com
   - **Role**: Choose "Buy Leads" or "Sell Leads"
   - **Password**: Min 8 chars with uppercase, lowercase, and number
   - **Confirm Password**: Match your password
3. Click "Create Account"
4. You should see a success message

### 5. Test Login

1. Go to `/login` or click "Sign In"
2. Enter your email and password
3. Click "Sign In"
4. You'll be redirected to your role-specific dashboard!
